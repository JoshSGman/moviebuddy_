Movie Buddy is an app that lets you easily organize movie outings with friends.

We all love going to movies with friends, but sometimes it's a challenge matching interests and schedules. That movie you’ve been looking forward to has just come out. You’ve been busy all week and by the time you are finally free to go out and watch the movie, many of your friends have already seen it. Now comes the pain of figuring out who still hasn’t seen the movie and when can they see it. Movie Buddy solves all this. 

Following a simple, secure login via Facebook, a personal feed of outings awaits you. Scroll through upcoming outings from your posted by your friends, and tap or click outings to join them. Or check out the “Now Playing” menu to browse what movies are in theatres near you. Build your personal MovieBuddy profile as much as you like, with your name, photo, movie genre and celebrity interests, favorite theatres, and preferred movie-going times. Finally, an easy-to-find account settings menu will keep you in control of how much you share and how you get notified. 

Movie Buddy. Your new best friend for going to the movies.
